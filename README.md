A random collection of programs for converting ROOT spectra to TV or Radware and vice versa. Also includes some old Miniball scripts for deducing detector angles or converting calibration files.

I honestly don't know what much of this is and it isn't really maintained. But it might be useful at some point and I have a habit of forgetting where things are.

Like recently, I updated 'mat2root', which is really useful for converting Radware matrix files into 2-dimensional ROOT spectra! You can use that one if you want.

Another handy one is 'root2tv', which outputs simple ASCII files of 1- and 2-dimension ROOT spectra in a number of formats.
